I have a file SACD iso and I want to convert this ISO to individual FLAC files.
Is it possible with Foobar

I suppose that you want to create disc image. Official FLAC encoder (for MS Windows) cannot create files >2GB. But OP wants to split SACD ISO to individual tracks and I think that he won't encounter this problem.

Anyway, here is modified FLAC encoder (thanks to Case): http://www.hydrogenaudio.org/forums/index....st&p=725304
